# 🧪 OSI Layer Packet Simulation using Wireshark

This mini project demonstrates how to simulate and analyze packets corresponding to various layers of the OSI model using Wireshark and basic Linux networking tools.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Simulate network traffic corresponding to different OSI layers
- Capture packets using **Wireshark**
- Analyze protocol behavior with Wireshark filters
- Create an annotated `.pcap` file
- Map tools, protocols, and OSI layers effectively

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Wireshark** – Packet Capture and Analysis
- **Netcat (nc)** – Simulate TCP connections
- **Curl** – Generate HTTP requests
- **Ping** – Generate ICMP packets
- **Telnet** (fallback: `netcat`) – Application layer testing
